# About this Template

In June 6, 2019 GitHub announced a new feature to [generate new repositories with repository templates]. At the [Alan IF Development team] we promptly grasped the great potential of this new cool feature and decided to create a repository template for Alan projects, and release it into the public domain.

You can use this template to quickly create a GitHub repository for Alan projects by clicking on the <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button placed on the bar above the files list, or [by clicking on this link].

Your new repository created using this template will be optimally configured for working with Alan tools, adventures, commands scripts and game transcripts.

For more detailed information on using repository templates, see:

- [GitHub Help » Creating a repository from a template]

To learn more about the internal details of this template, consult the [repository Wiki].

## What Do I Get?

The template is just a boilerplate containing some Git configurations designed to optimize Alan workflows. Spcifically, you'll get `.gitgnore` and `.gitattributes` files with carefully designed patterns that will cover a variety of Alan usage scenarios in cross-platform environments.

You also get this markdown README file that you're reading right now, which contains the _[Useful Alan Links]_ section providing links to various Alan related assets, which you might reuse in your project. It's a well structured markdown document, with many reference links to Alan assets (at the end of the source document) which might come handy — and could spare you a good amount of typing, if you're going to link to other Alan projects.

If you don't need the README file you can just trash it, but chances are that you'll be adding a `README.md` file to your project anyway, so you might as well just overwrite it, or keep just those reference links that you need. After some initial thoughts, I finally decided that it was better to include this README file in the template, for the benefit of those wishing to offer links to the Alan community and assets, rather than leave it out. For those who'll need it, it's going to be a true time-saver, while those who don't need it shouldn't be bothered much by having to delete/overwrite it.
